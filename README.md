# NoMoreTroll
A fun little Freeze and tp mod for admins.


### Install:
Click the clone or download button and click download **zip**, once downloaded unzip the file and rename NoMoreTroll-master to NoMoreTroll and put this within your resource folder of your FiveM server.

To be able to use it all the time, open up your **server.cfg** and add **ensure NoMoreTroll** to the list of ensures, if you only want to use this script now and then and don't want it in your **server.cfg** then in game or via the server control type **refresh**(server/F8) or **/refresh** via the chat this will get the server to find the new files, then do **start NoMoreTroll** or **/start NoMoreTroll** from the chat.

### How to use:
In game do **/freeze PLAYERSERVERID true** or **false**, if you do **/freeze PLAYERSERVERID true** then **/tpj** it will TP you to that player, once you have dealt with the problem you can unfreeze them or kick them and use **/tpj** to return to where you was before.




### Can I use this script:
Yes please feel free to fork it as much and has hard as you like, this is under the WTFPL
